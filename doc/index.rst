Latin squares, sudoku puzzles and related designs
=================================================

Rysa is a Python library for modelling latin squares and related designs. In
Rysa you will find components for building partial combinatorial structures
as well as algorithmic components for investigating the completability of
particular structures. The modelling components of Rysa are written in Python
but algorithms which operate on those models are written in C/C++ whenever 
possible. In fact, most of the algorithmic components of Rysa are pre-existing
libraries or programs.

This is the main documentation page for Rysa. Here you can find links to
introductory material, explaining the concepts behind this software, a 
tutorial demonstrating how to use the software and documentation on every
module as well as tests for every module.
