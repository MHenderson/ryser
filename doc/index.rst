Latin squares, sudoku puzzles and related designs
=================================================

Rysa is a Python library for modelling latin squares and related designs. In
Rysa you will find components for building partial combinatorial structures
as well as algorithmic components for investigating the completability of
particular instances of such structures. The modelling components of Rysa are 
written in Python but algorithms which operate on those models are written in 
C/C++ whenever possible. In fact, most of the algorithmic components of Rysa 
are pre-existing libraries or programs.

This is the main documentation page for Rysa. Here you can find links to
introductory material which explains the concepts behind Rysa, a tutorial which
demonstrates how to use Rysa as well as documentation for every module of Rysa
and tests of all those modules.
